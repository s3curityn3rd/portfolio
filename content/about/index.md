Hello! My name is Michael Register, and I am an Information Security professional. I've been working in InfoSec since 2017 where I start as a SOC analyst. From there I moved into Incident Response with a focus on Digital Forensics and Malware Analysis. I'm the coauthor of the DFIR Against the Dark Arts training series for beginner security analysts. 

In my spare time - when I find it - I like playing video games, breaking something in my home network by accident, or learning something new! This site is intended to be a lightly maintained personal site for profiling myself, and also some blog entries as I decide to go down that path.
